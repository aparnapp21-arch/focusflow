Project Description

FocusFlow is a real-time focus and productivity tracker that helps you stay intentional during work or study sessions.
You choose a session duration—like 30 or 60 minutes—and FocusFlow actively tracks distractions as they happen. At the end of each session, it generates a Focus Score along with insights to help you improve your attention habits over time.

🧩 Problem Statement

We live in a hyper-connected world ruled by constant notifications, social media feeds, and digital overload.
Research shows the average human attention span has dropped below that of a goldfish.

This leads to:

Frequent task-switching

Reduced efficiency

Mental fatigue

Inability to perform deep, meaningful work

FocusFlow addresses this critical challenge by helping users understand and improve their focus, one session at a time.

💡 The Solution

FocusFlow works like a personal trainer for your attention.

It helps you build consistent focus habits through:

Real-time distraction tracking

Insightful feedback

Visual progress charts

Session-by-session comparison

A clean and minimal interface designed to reduce cognitive load

The goal is continuous improvement in attention and productivity.
